# Tic-Tac-Toe
Uses the turtle module to create a 2-player game.

**Instructions:** Left click on any empty space to make a move (first player is circle; second player is x). 
To play again or reset the board at any point press spacebar. You can quit at any time using escape.  

***Note:** The turtle is already set at max speed but wait a second after making a move for the turtle to finish drawing all the animations.
